>generate-truss-analysis-fractal-canva2D

## Description
 The Fractal Truss Analysis Tool is an interactive web application designed to visualize stress distribution within a truss structure. Using fractal algorithms, it dynamically generates complex truss patterns and calculates stress based on a user-defined point of force application. The tool also leverages the joint method for force analysis, providing a unique blend of mathematical rigor and visual appeal.


## Features

- Dynamic Truss Generation: Create intricate truss structures using fractal algorithms.
- Interactive Canvas: Click on the canvas to set the point of force application and watch the truss stress visualization in real-time.
- Stress Visualization: Visual representation of stress using color gradients, from cool (low stress) to hot (high stress).
- Ground Reactions: Visualize the reactions at the ground vertices for a comprehensive understanding of the force distribution.
- Customizable: Adjust the force value and refinement level to simulate different scenarios.


## How to Use

1. Open the web application.
2. Set the desired force value and refinement level.
3. Click anywhere on the canvas to set the point of force application.
4. Observe the generated truss and the stress visualization.


## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
Bootstrap for responsive design.
Canvas API for rendering truss and visualization.
