 The Fractal Truss Analysis Tool is an interactive web application designed to visualize stress distribution within a truss structure. Using fractal algorithms, it dynamically generates complex truss patterns and calculates stress based on a user-defined point of force application. The tool also leverages the joint method for force analysis, providing a unique blend of mathematical rigor and visual appeal.
